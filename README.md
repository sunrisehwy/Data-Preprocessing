# Data-Preprocessing
Class Exercise : EDA, Imbalanced Data handling (Resampling, SMOTE), Feature Engineering, Feature Extraction


(1) Homesite Quote Conversion (Kaggel, https://www.kaggle.com/c/homesite-quote-conversion)
- Method : Stack Model (Random forest, SVM,, multilayer perceptron and KNN)
- Objective : Build a dynamic conversion rate model that can give them confidence a quoted price will lead to a purchase for Homesite, a leading provider of homeowners insurance by using an anonymized database of information on customer and sales activity, including property and coverage information. 
- Process : 
SMOTE to handle imbalanced data, and Ensemble predictions (stacking) using different types of prediction models
